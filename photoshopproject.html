							<p><b>Prompt: In his Third Critique (The Critique of Judgment), Immanuel Kant states that: <br>
								<div>In painting, in sculpture, indeed in all the visual arts, including architecture and horticulture 
									insofar as they are fine arts, design is what is essentialâ€¦ The colors that illuminate the outline 
									belong to charm. Though they can indeed make the object itself vivid to sense, they cannot make it 
									beautiful and worthy of being beheld.</div> <br>
								
								<div>Your goal for this project is to prove Kant wrong. Use color as the primary medium in the creation 
									of two works: one using additive color and another using subtractive color. </div></b>
								</p>

							<p>With this project, I wanted to explore the use of color, and it seemed fitting to use images of
								the sky, whose colors never fail to make me stop in my tracks and stare up in awe. Selected from hundreds 
								of sky pictures in my camera roll, these images come together to form a sky of skies, creating the
								background of this piece. Then, I layered clouds on top and adjusted the color channels to experiment
								with how different colored clouds appear on different sky backgrounds. The CMYK version was created first,
								and the RGB version was created by simply adjusting the color channels for each cloud from the CMYK version. 
								The color channels were deliberately changed by taking into account the fact that the CMYK color mode is the
								inverse of the RGB color mode. For example, if a cloud in the CMYK version had only the cyan channel on, 
								the red channel was removed in the RGB version. In addition, the CMYK version was printed out on an 18 x 44 
								inch piece of matte paper. The matte paper adds to the soft mutedness and fuzziness of the colors. 
								As a future endeavor, it could be interesting to print out the RGB version and see how the colors turn out,
								particularly if the work is printed out on glossy paper instead. It would also be cool to try printing on an even 
								larger scale, such as printing out each square individually before piecing them together. 
								All in all, this piece is meant to capture the beauty of the sky, and thus the beauty of color.</p>
