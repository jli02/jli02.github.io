							<p><b>Prompt: Create a set of conditions by which you derive a series of paths using Illustrator, and realize a physical manifestation of these conditions using the laser cutters in the Brown Design Workshop.</b></p>
							<p>Inspired by traditional Chinese paper cutting and its association with luck and happiness, 
								I created and layered paper cut-outs to depict an image of what happiness looks like to me: 
								a family eating dinner together. The four layers were drawn in Illustrator and 
								cut with a laser cutter before being sewn together with red thread. I originally wanted many layers with many scenes associated with things I am grateful for, and I
								wanted the piece to be able to stand on its own, like a book cracked open, so that the viewer could see each individual page.
								However, due to time constraints, I only created the four pages, but in the future, I would like to explore using more 
								layers, as well as paper of different textures and transparencies. </p>
