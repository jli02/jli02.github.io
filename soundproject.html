							<p> I am interested in the relationships between sound and image, 
								such as graphic scores that visually represent notes or the translation from an image to audio. I wanted 
								to create an interactive piece that explores both senses of sight and hearing, and I ended up with these 
								movable panels that make sounds as they rub against surfaces beneath them. The panels can also be rearranged 
								to create layers with different visuals. The panels are wood and acrylic, and the materials that line the 
								bottom are sandpaper, carpet, and patterns engraved on plywood. The pieces were designed in Illustrator and 
								cut out using a laser cutter. Although I originally wanted to incorporate a score, I think it could be 
								possible to use this piece as an instrument and create a score from it rather than the piece being a score 
								itself. Another way to extend this project is to try making the panels from different materials or adding 
								other materials on top of the panels, such as the addition of sandpaper or fabric. Furthermore, I observed that
								people interacted with the piece differently, being either more drawn to the visual or audible 
								aspects of it, and it could be interesting to try to incorporate a more tangible, textural feature, too. I'd 
								like to think of this as a prototype, but I am still pretty happy with how it turned out. At least I am very, 
								very comfortable with the laser cutter now. I hope to continue experimenting with how we can experience sounds 
								and images differently. </p>
