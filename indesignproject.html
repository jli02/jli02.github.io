							<p><b>Prompt: Create a small chapbook or “zine” using precisely none of your own content. Beg, borrow, steal. <br></b></p>
								
							<p>Created on the brink of my 20th birthday, this zine is a compilation of some thoughts that consume my mind
								as I grow up and grow older. It is a reflection on the bittersweetness of growing up and the anxiety of not 
								knowing what to do with yourself but also embraces the uncertainty and unpredictability of life. None of the pictures 
								or words are my own but most are taken from songs, books, and poems that I love. The zine was created using InDesign, 
								and I wish I used more of InDesign's features to rearrange text in different shapes and configurations. I really enjoyed
								making this zine, and I hope to continue making zines in the future!
